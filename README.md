This is my Ruby solution to the [Reddit Daily Programmer Challenge #321](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/6jr76h/20170627_challenge_321_easy_talking_clock/)

To run the script, just call `ruby talking_clock.rb` in the Terminal from the directory where this file lives.

It assumes the input is a string.

TODO: add chinese
TODO: don't assume input is string
TODO: add edge cases (midnight, noon, half past, etc)
